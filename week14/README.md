# Week14 Projects
Notice the Week14 is just a folder that contains Java project, so it's not a Java project folder as we did in the previous weeks.

**Also the code/content of these JavaFX project is based on my previous repo["JavaFX GUI Application"](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/java-gui-javafx), you can refer to that repo for more details and clarifications.
